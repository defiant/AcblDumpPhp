##AcblDumpPhp

This is an attempt to convert the ACBLDump script (originally in Perl) to PHP.

Currently it's not tested and probably not running as intended. 
I'll get back to it when I have time. I put it here in case anyone is interested to contribute or tinker with it.

The original ACBLDump is written by Matthew Kidd and all credit goes to him. More can be found at http://lajollabridge.com/Software/ACBLgamedump/ACBLgamedump-About.htm
